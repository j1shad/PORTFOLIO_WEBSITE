## Introduction

Apache Airflow has become the de facto standard for orchestrating complex data workflows. In this guide, we'll walk through setting up Airflow and creating your first DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph).

## Why Airflow?

Airflow provides several key benefits for data engineering teams:

- **Dynamic Pipeline Generation**: DAGs are defined as Python code, making them dynamic and version-controllable
- **Extensive Integration**: Built-in operators for most data platforms and tools
- **Rich UI**: Monitor and manage workflows through an intuitive web interface
- **Scalability**: Easily scale from local development to production clusters

## Setting Up Airflow

First, install Airflow using pip:

```bash
pip install apache-airflow
```

Initialize the database:

```bash
airflow db init
```

Create an admin user:

```bash
airflow users create \
    --username admin \
    --firstname Admin \
    --lastname User \
    --role Admin \
    --email admin@example.com
```

## Creating Your First DAG

Here's a simple DAG that demonstrates the basic structure:

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

default_args = {
    'owner': 'data-team',
    'depends_on_past': False,
    'start_date': datetime(2024, 1, 1),
    'email_on_failure': True,
    'email_on_retry': False,
    'retries': 2,
    'retry_delay': timedelta(minutes=5),
}

def extract_data():
    print("Extracting data from source...")
    return "data_extracted"

def transform_data():
    print("Transforming data...")
    return "data_transformed"

def load_data():
    print("Loading data to warehouse...")
    return "data_loaded"

with DAG(
    'simple_etl_pipeline',
    default_args=default_args,
    description='A simple ETL data pipeline',
    schedule_interval=timedelta(days=1),
    catchup=False,
) as dag:

    extract = PythonOperator(
        task_id='extract',
        python_callable=extract_data,
    )

    transform = PythonOperator(
        task_id='transform',
        python_callable=transform_data,
    )

    load = PythonOperator(
        task_id='load',
        python_callable=load_data,
    )

    extract >> transform >> load
```

## Best Practices

1. **Idempotency**: Ensure tasks can be run multiple times without side effects
2. **Task Atomicity**: Keep tasks small and focused on a single responsibility
3. **Error Handling**: Implement proper retry logic and alerting
4. **Testing**: Test DAGs locally before deploying to production

## Conclusion

Apache Airflow is a powerful tool for building and managing data pipelines. This guide covered the basics, but there's much more to explore including sensors, branching, dynamic task generation, and integration with various data platforms.
