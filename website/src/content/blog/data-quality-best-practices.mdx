## The Importance of Data Quality

Poor data quality can undermine even the most sophisticated analytics initiatives. In this post, we'll explore practical strategies for ensuring data quality throughout your pipelines.

## Key Dimensions of Data Quality

### 1. Accuracy
Data should correctly represent real-world values.

```python
def validate_email(email: str) -> bool:
    import re
    pattern = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'
    return bool(re.match(pattern, email))
```

### 2. Completeness
Required fields should always be populated.

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(*) as total_records,
    COUNT(user_id) as records_with_user_id,
    (COUNT(*) - COUNT(user_id)) as missing_user_ids
FROM users;
```

### 3. Consistency
Data should be consistent across different systems.

### 4. Timeliness
Data should be available when needed.

## Implementing Data Quality Checks

### Using dbt Tests

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: users
    columns:
      - name: user_id
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
      - name: email
        tests:
          - not_null
          - unique
      - name: created_at
        tests:
          - not_null
```

### Custom Quality Checks

```python
from great_expectations import DataContext

def run_quality_checks(df):
    context = DataContext()

    expectations = {
        'expect_column_values_to_not_be_null': ['user_id', 'email'],
        'expect_column_values_to_be_unique': ['user_id'],
        'expect_column_values_to_be_in_set': {
            'status': ['active', 'inactive', 'pending']
        }
    }

    return df.validate(expectations)
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

Set up automated monitoring to catch data quality issues early:

- **Volume Checks**: Alert on unexpected changes in record counts
- **Schema Changes**: Detect when column types or names change
- **Value Distributions**: Monitor statistical properties of your data
- **Freshness**: Ensure data is updating as expected

## Conclusion

Data quality is not a one-time effort but an ongoing process. By implementing these practices and tools, you can build trust in your data and make better-informed decisions.
